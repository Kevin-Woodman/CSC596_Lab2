Running Instructions. Ensure all files have been 

A. Go Routine Implementation (without RPC):
In a command prompt move into the go_routine_version directory and run it from there
    $ cd go_routine_version
    $ go run gossip_no_rpc.go 

B. RPC Implementation

Please run server.go and client.go in this outer folder, to run simply use: go run server.go, and go run client.go <id>. id is a number from 0-7

I never figured out the errors, but for some reason as soon as I moved the readMessage() function from runAfterY to runAfterX in this new version broke.

I have also provided the broken copies as proof I had work before adapting your working net-code. The code I ultimately wrote is most similar to my code in c.go and s.go.
